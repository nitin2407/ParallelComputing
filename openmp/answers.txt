1) Yes, as n is big, with greater values of granularity, each thread has less work to do., so we get better speed up. 
2) Yes, when n is less, there is not much enough work to do, so there is a lot of overhead of threads. But when n is big, we get a good speed up.
3) Yes, we observed that there is not much speed up, because in prefix sum, dependencies still exists in code. 
4) Yes, to get more speed up, we need to parallelize merge sort also.
