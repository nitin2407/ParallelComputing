Q1) 

2) Some measurements can be erratic as, due to overhead of time measurements of mutex locks. 
There can be sudden best and worst cases which makes values differ significantly.   
	
3) speed up of low intensity is low because there is more wait time for mutex as calculations are done quickly

4) thread vs iteration: Thread just locks mutex once per thread, so its performance is better , as the total wait time for resources is less.

Q2) 

2) The speed up accross 16 threads is almost similar for chunk and thread level, but for iteration level, speed up is small. 
This can be bacause of the overhead of locking the mutex again and again in each loop.

3)  At 16 threads and thread level synconization, taking different n and intensity, we observe that speed up is high with higher values of n.
Intensity is not making a significant difference in speed up.
